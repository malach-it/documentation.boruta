# Clients configuration | General configuration

Client attributes help __manage the authorization capabilities for OAuth 2.0 and satellites flows__. They provide a high level of customization helping the server to be integrated within infrastructures seamlessly. Those configurations help the flows to be both business and technically adapted for the addressed use case.
